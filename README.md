## Description

This web app simulates dice rolls for players of Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPG). Features include rolling advantage and disadvantage on d20 rolls as well as rolling multiple dice of the same type. This portfolio project was a first foray into creating and hosting a web app with some custom interactive elements.

## Challenges

This was the first project of mine to be hosted. As such, learning the process of deploying (originally on Heroku, but later moved to Render) was a great learning experience. In addition, the practical use of both grid and flex showed me the immense flexibility of control that CSS can grant a web developer.
